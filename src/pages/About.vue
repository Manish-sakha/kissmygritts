      <h1>About the Site</h1>
      <p>
        Right now, this very instant, someone is struggling with code. I know because 
        on any given day I am that person. Countless times I've discovered the answer
        to my problems on a blog, forum, or StackOverflow. I wouldn't be where I am 
        without people constantly contributing to this knowledge base. This site is my
        attempt to help a struggling data analyst, ecologist, and developers where I can.

        Also, learning in the open is the best way to learn.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I taught myself how to program with R while in college. Every new statistics course 
        I took used a different tool, Minitab, SAS, SPSS. I had heard of MATLAB, but 
        that wasn't free. I don't remember how I discovered R. But the decision to learn 
        it was one of the best decisions I ever made.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've since taught myself a few other languages. At work we use SQL and Python. 
        I saw a need to expand to the web at my job and began learning web development. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm not sure how to classify myself when people as what I do. My degree is in 
        wildlife ecology. My work is data management. I've developed websites and web 
        apps at work too. I dream of being a badass data analyst. Every time I try and 
        choose one of these boxes I get major FOMO. Maybe one day I can successfully do 
        all these things!

The last few weeks got away from me. The Wildlife Society annual conference was here in Reno, and I spent all week networking with many great people from all over the country. 

## Watching

### The Chef Show - Netflix

I began watching this over the weekend. One of the episodes made a very interesting point. Roy and Jon were talking (and showing) about learning to learn. Once you crack the code on learning, you can do anything. It is super interesting to see how good Jon is at multiple things (directing, acting, cooking, drawing, ...).
